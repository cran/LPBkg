Description: Given a postulated model and a set of data, the comparison density is estimated and the deviance test is implemented in order to assess if the data distribution deviates significantly from the postulated model. Finally, the results are summarized in a CD-plot as described in Algeri S. (2019) <arXiv:1906.06615>.
